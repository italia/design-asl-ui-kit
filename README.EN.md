## Description

This repository contains the UI Kit for the website template for local health authorities (ASL) in Italy.

The kit includes the following resources:

- sample layouts of the main pages of the site;
- page type templates;
- component library;
- a guide to customizing the template;
- prototypes of the main navigation flows.

The kit, available for both Figma and Sketch, provides a clear framework of what a website example should look like and how it should function, helping you maintain visual and functional consistency with the model standards.

Please note: some features present in Figma (.fig) files may not be present and/or correct in .sketch files converted using the latest version of fig2sketch. It is therefore recommended to always check the conversion result and declare the status of resources and this eventuality to users.

## Getting Started

Download the latest available version on the [Releases](https://github.com/italia/design-asl-ui-kit/releases) page. Each release includes files for both Figma and Sketch. Once downloaded, you can open the files with the respective design programs and start exploring the resources.
